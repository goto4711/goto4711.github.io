Tobias Blanke is University Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Humanities at the University of Amsterdam and the Institute of Logic, Language, and Computation. He is also affiliated with King's College London as Professor of Social and Cultural Informatics. His academic background is in computer science and political philosophy. Blanke's principal research interests lie in artificial intelligence and big data devices for research, particularly in the human sciences. He has also published extensively on ethical questions of Artificial Intelligence such as predictive policing and algorithmic otherings, as well as critical digital practices, and the critique of digital platforms.

Some Work
======

Over the years I have published in a number of different fields. I am trying to show that computing and information science knowledge can be used for a critical understanding of digital societies. I am also really interested in pushing data science techniques to target difference and discontinuities and not just large-scale patterns. Finally, I enjoy working with others on integrating resources and knowledge. 

- How can describe growing platform monopolisation differently? The article [Material Conditions of Platforms] (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305120971632) looks at monopolisation through decentralisation in the mobile ecosystem.

- What would data science look like for critical humanities interests? We attempt an answer in [Computational Genealogy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01615440.2019.1684859?casa_token=UwDllgv8ih8AAAAA%3AE_dzKTk0OS4SwtAXj5kIeN_tuRStxzlps5nki6w5rfiYMqsV1-GQQIRryK5LsIUbemltebrpfIOIv3U&).

- How is the 'other' made by algorithms? The technologies developed for the 'war on terror' can give us an idea: [Governing Others: Anomaly and the Algorithmic Subject of Security](https://bit.ly/3o7wn2E).

- In the [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure](http://ehri-project.eu), we have used novel graph databases to heterogeneous humanities knowledge since 2012. [Integrating Holocaust Research](https://bit.ly/3oaTxF9) still provides a good introduction.

- 'Scholarly primitives' can help understand how computing and humanities research can come together, as we present in [Scholarly Primitives](https://bit.ly/39GDw16).



A Few Projects
======

Academic work means a lot of project work nowadays --- at least for me. I particularly enjoy working with others in collaborative projects. To give you some ideas:

- Over the years we had a number of projects, helping citizens make sense of the datafication processes they are exposed to. [Our Data Ourselves](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FL007770%2F1) was the first project to look at mobile datafications.

- The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure](http://ehri-project.eu) has been going strong since 2009. We are now in the third phase and there is still much more to do.

- [AI4Media](https://www.ai4media.eu/) is a European centre of excellence in AI research. We work with artificial intelligence researchers across Europe focussing on the social impact of AI.
